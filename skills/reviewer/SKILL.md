Review the paper as an ARR reviewer would, so the authors see the weaknesses before real reviewers do. The review form and reviewer guidelines change between cycles; every run fetches them.

`PK` means `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/paperkit.py`, run from the project root.

## 1. Fetch the form

```
PK guidelines reviewer
```

It downloads the ARR review form and reviewer guidelines into a temp folder. On ⚠️: tell the user what is missing and stop, since a review against a remembered form would mislead. Read both in full: the form fields, the score scales with their descriptions, and what the guidelines tell reviewers to do and to avoid (the guidelines list common unhelpful review patterns; a useful review avoids them too).

## 2. Context

Ask with AskUserQuestion what changes the review and is not in the project: the track or area the paper is submitted to, long or short, and whether it is a resubmission. For a resubmission, ask for the previous reviews and meta-review (offer `reviews/`): a reviewer of a resubmission checks whether the earlier weaknesses were addressed, so the review must do the same.

## 3. Compliance first

Load and run the `guidelines-check` skill, carrying over the answers from step 2 so it asks only what is still open. Its findings (including the Responsible NLP checklist) go to `report.md` as usual and inform the review's soundness and ethics fields.

## 4. Read like a reviewer

Read the whole paper in reading order, including appendices, once without writing. Then review it:

- What is the claim, and does the evidence carry it? Baselines, ablations, statistical significance, data splits, contamination, number of runs.
- Is it reproducible from the paper (hyperparameters, prompts, data, code)?
- Related work: is the closest prior work present? Search with the `acl-anthology` and `arxiv` skills for work the paper should compare to, and read what you name (the `literature` skill) before saying the paper misses it.
- Clarity: could a reader in the area reimplement it?

Apply the persona or focus from the argument if one was given; otherwise review as a competent, fair reviewer from the paper's area.

## 5. Write review.md

Fill every field of the fetched form in `review.md` in the project root, in the form's order and with its field names: summaries, strengths, weaknesses, comments, every score with a one-line justification using the scale's own wording. Each weakness names the place in the paper and what would fix it. Overwrite an earlier `review.md` only after asking; otherwise number it (`review-2.md`).

## 6. Report items

Each weakness that the authors can fix before submission becomes an item in `report.md`, category `Review`, severity by how much it would move the score. Weaknesses that need new experiments are 🔴 or 🟠 with the experiment named.

Report in chat: the overall assessment with its score, the three weaknesses most likely to sink the paper, and what fixes them.
